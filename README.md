# HappyNumber
A "happy number" in mathematics is a concept where we take a positive integer and repeatedly replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. This process continues until the number either becomes 1 (which means it is a happy number) or enters a cycle that does not include 1 (making it an unhappy number).
